        <p>I’m a student at Duke University passionate about accessible design and cats. I'm constantly looking for small, new details in my surroundings, and I’m always excited to learn from everything and everyone around me.</p>

                <h3>150 Faces of Durham Virtual Exhibit</h3>
                <p>I developed and implemented the first version of a virtual exhibit featuring 150 historical figures of Durham for the Museum of Durham history. I was involved in all aspects of the development process, from initial designs to coding the front- and back-end to launching a production site, and will be continuing this project throughout the fall.</p>

                <h3>Wearable Microbial Air Collector</h3>
                <p>I designed, built, and tested a wearable working prototype device that would take in samples of airborne microbes from the surrounding environment. A research professor at Duke's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering commissioned this project, as existing collection devices were expensive and too bulky to wear daily.</p>
